                <p>Inspired by “Xorandor” by Christine Brock-Rose and Sapara Mythology, Pape and Speiser’s work “Dream Stones” invites into an AR experience in which perception 
                of time between humans and stones are synchronised. Through the collaborative manipulation of the virtual and the physical the viewers step into dialogue with
                the dream stone worlds.</p>
                <p> This new creation extends their inquiry on embodied immersion which they started in Touching Clouds 
                to questions of co-presence, both of humans and other (artificial) forms of intelligence.</p>

                <h2>A-Life: Life is a property of form</h2>
                For the development of <a href="digital.html">Touching Clouds</a>, I had to dive into the world of <i>shaders</i>, which are small bits of code executed directly on the GPU. Its parallel processing capability makes surprising real-time simulations of natural process such as swarms and fluid dynamics possible. I am starting to dedicate some time to read up on the
                surprising cross-polinations of (theoretical) biology, computer science and art. The image below is snapshot of a GPU run fluid simulation based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">incompressible Navier Stokes equations</a>.
                <img src="/images/smoke.jpg" alt="NavierStokes" width="100%">
                <br />
                What if the complexity of the world around us emerged out fo the interaction of particles following simple rules?
                1952, Alan Turing starts off his influential speculative article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis"> The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</a> with a strong hypothesis:
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    <i>It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. </i>
                </p>
                <img src="/images/cellular.jpg" alt="CellularAutomata" width="100%">
                <p>
                    In a similar vein but in the 1980s and coming from the now firmly establish field computer science, Christopher Langston notes in his seminal text "Artifical Life":
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    <i>The most surprising lesson we have learned from simulating complex physical systems on computers is that complex behaviour need not have complex roots.</i>
                </p>
                Polemically, he claims:
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    Life is a property of <i>form</i>, not <i>matter</i>, a result of the organization of matter rather than something that inheres in the matter itself. [...] It is effects, not things, upon which life is based &#8212; life is a kind of behaviour, not a kind of stuff [...]. <i>Behaviours themselves </i> can constitute the fundamental parts of non-linear systems &#8212; <i>virtual parts </i>, which depend on non-linear interactions between physical parts for their very existence. Isolate the physical parts and the virtual parts cease to exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What he calls the virtual is often described in the language of partial differential equations. However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. Today's computing power enables us to numerically approximate solutions and simulate the dynamic processes. One way to do so is by discretization, which means simplifying the problem by splitting smooth spaces into grid-like collections of cells and continuous time into a series of time intervals (steps).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One then translates the partial differential equations into rules defining how cells act upon each other given a short time interval. And voilà, we can now let a computer do the work of computing the state of the cells. Fairly recent developments in GPUs greatly enhance such simulation processes through their 'parallel processing' capability: the state of the cells in the grid are not computed consecutively, but all at the same time!
                    These developments have had an enormous impact on scientific research, but also easthetics. A-Life is ubiquitous in CGI production. Here is another famous example of a dynamical system which can be thought of as the simulation of some sort of bacterial culture:

                <p>
                    Working with the Belgian composer Simon Halsberghe to gain a better understanding of the Jacki Lieberman Set. The German percussionist Jaki Liebezeit worked on the set of all possible rhythmical patterns consisting of 1s and 2s, i.e. short and long beats. To complicate the matter considerably, cyclic permutations are considered equal. Formally, this set is defined as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$ J := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} J_n $$

                    Simon is looking for a constructive way to generate all the patterns of a given length. We have implemented an algorithm, the computing time however quickly exceeds reasonable limits. The follow up question is: How many patterns of a given length $n$ exist? We computed values for $n \leq 26$, but have not yet found the formula for any $n$.

                <p> - a choreographic object
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;"> <i>How many angels fit in a cloud? This outdated medieval scholastic problem reemerges today in guise of clouds, bits and data. While much our work consists of manipulating data, we seldom ask: how does it feel like to touch data? What do clouds feel like?
                                                   </i></p>

    Digitus (lat. “fingerbreadth“, „number“) stems from the Proto-Indo-European *deyǵ- (“to show, point out”). New technologies enable us to, quite literally, touch and handle digital objects. This folding back of touch onto abstraction provides a fertile setting to explore both their materiality and the way they, in turn, move us through space: a choreography.

                    Digit(al) is an augmented reality piece, as well as a choreographic installation: in a sufficiently large and empty space, informal seating opportunities
                    and headsets are offered to the audience. Those that choose to put on a headset will see the space and people around them enriched with virtual floating stones and leaves, which respond to touch and movement in various ways. The exploration of the virtual space guides them through the real space, producing a choreography that can be watched by other audience members.
